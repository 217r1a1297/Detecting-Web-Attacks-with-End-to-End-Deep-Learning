# Detecting-Web-Attacks-with-End-to-End-Deep-Learning
**Introduction:**
Detecting Web Attacks with End-to-End Deep Learning is a deep learning-based project focused on identifying and classifying malicious web traffic. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to keep up with the growing sophistication of modern cyber threats. This project leverages neural networks to automate the detection of common web-based attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and firewalls often rely on rule-based detection, which may miss novel or evolving threats. This project utilizes a neural network-based, end-to-end deep learning approach to detect and classify common web attacks such as:

1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)
4. Path Traversal
And more...
The goal is to build a model that can automatically learn patterns from request data and accurately identify whether a web request is malicious or benign.

**Technologies Used:**

1. Python 
2. TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
3. Scikit-learn
4. Pandas, NumPy
5. Matplotlib / Seaborn
6. Jupyter Notebook
