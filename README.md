# Detecting-Web-Attacks-with-End-to-End-Deep-Learning
Detecting Web Attacks with End-to-End Deep Learning is a deep learning-based project focused on identifying and classifying malicious web traffic. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to keep up with the growing sophistication of modern cyber threats. This project leverages neural networks to automate the detection of common web-based attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.

By using an end-to-end deep learning approach, this system learns directly from raw or structured input dataâ€”removing the need for extensive manual feature engineering. The goal is to improve detection accuracy and adaptability in real-world, dynamic web environments.
